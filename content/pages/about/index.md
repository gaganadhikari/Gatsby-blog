Hello! My name is Gagan Adhikari and I am a backend developer with two years of experience. I have a strong background in computer science and a passion for problem-solving. 

![Welcome to my blog site.](/ban.jpg)

I enjoy tackling complex technical challenges and developing efficient, scalable solutions. While I do have an appreciation for design, I tend to focus more on the logical and functional aspects of development. In my current role, I have gained expertise in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Laravel, Js, React.Js, Golang. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I am excited to continue my career in this dynamic and constantly evolving field.
