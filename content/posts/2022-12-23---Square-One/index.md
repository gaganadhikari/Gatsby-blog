I always find myself whining and ranting about not being able to get better at expressing myself i and not getting my shit together, so i always had this idea of start writing and reading often which i had been delaying for no any specific reason but my laziness which would also solve my issue i had been whining about.

![Me writing my first blog](/media/laptop.jpg)

I have been writing mostly PHP and JS recently and its been a while since i wanted to learn something new. So i came up with a plan to learn Go and document my journey here, I love helping people learn things they're passonate about so i will be learning myself and help others learn too.
I will try to write here at least once a week so keep visiting to overview my Go journey .
**Peace ✌️**
